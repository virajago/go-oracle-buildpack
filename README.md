# Cloud Foundry Go(Lang) Buildpack
[![CF Slack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildpacks-assets/buildpacks-slack.svg)](http://slack.cloudfoundry.org)

A Cloud Foundry [buildpack](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/) for Go(lang) based apps.

This is based on the [Heroku buildpack] (https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-go).

### Buildpack User Documentation

Official buildpack documentation can be found at http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/go/index.html).

### Building the Buildpack

1. Make sure you have fetched submodules

  ```bash
  git submodule update --init
  ```

1. Get latest buildpack dependencies

  ```shell
  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle
  ```

1. Build the buildpack

  ```shell
  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-packager [ --uncached | --cached ]
  ```

1. Use in Cloud Foundry

  Upload the buildpack to your Cloud Foundry and optionally specify it by name

  ```bash
  cf create-buildpack custom_go_buildpack go_buildpack-cached-custom.zip 1
  cf push my_app -b custom_go_buildpack
  ```

### Testing
Buildpacks use the [Machete](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/machete) framework for running integration tests.

To test a buildpack, run the following command from the buildpack's directory:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-build
```

More options can be found on Machete's [Github page.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/machete)
